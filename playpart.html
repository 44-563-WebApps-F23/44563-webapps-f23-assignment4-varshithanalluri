   <p> <b>HEDDA.</b><br>
    Dear me--did I happen to hit you?</p>
    <p><b>BRACK.</b>
        <h5>[Still outside.]</h5> I wish you would let these pranks alone!</p><br>
    <p><b>HEDDA.</b><br>
        Come in then, Judge.<br>
            JUDGE BRACK, dressed as though for a men's party, enters by
              the glass door.  He carries a light overcoat over his arm.</p>
    <p><b>BRACK.</b><br>
        What the deuce--haven't you tired of that sport, yet? What are you
        shooting at?</p>
    <p><b>HEDDA.</b><br>
        Oh, I am only firing in the air.</p>
        <p><b>BRACK.</b>
        <h5>[Gently takes the pistol out of her hand.] Allow me, madam! [Looks at
        it.] </h5>Ah--I know this pistol well! [Looks around.] Where is the case? Ah,
        here it is. [Lays the pistol in it, and shuts it.] Now we won't play at
        thast game any more to-day.</p>
<p><b>HEDDA.</b><br>
    Then what in heaven's name would you have me do with myself?</p>
   <p><b>BRACK.</b><br>
    Have you had no visitors?</p>
